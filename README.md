# NeetCode-Journey

Hi, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! I followed the [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) roadmap to build a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures, step by step. I've organized my solutions into folders, with each folder corresponding to a different topic in the NeetCode curriculum. Each solution is stored in a separate file named after the corresponding LeetCode problem number.

All solutions are written in Python.

## How to Add a New Solution

To add a new solution, simply copy the `template.py` file into the appropriate topic folder and rename it to match the LeetCode problem youâ€™re solving. Use this command:

```bash
cp template.py topic/00-problem-name.py
